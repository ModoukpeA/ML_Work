**# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF FEATURE EXTRACTION AND SELECTION EFFECT ON A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL PERFORMANCE: A TIME SERIES ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN A LOW-ENERGY HOUSE

**Abstract**

This work presents and discusses the effect of feature extraction and feature selection on a linear
regression model performance on an energy consumption dataset. The dataset used is a
multivariate and timeseries data on energy consumption, with 19,735 instances and 29 attributes
collected over 4.5 months. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis and visualization of
energy consumption over time, build a linear regression model to estimate the consumption for
appliances, perform dimensionality reduction and feature selection, and compare the results. The
project requires a 70-30% train-test split on the data, and the performance of the regression models
will be evaluated. As results, we find that the Linear regression model was not performing well even
after the dimensionality reduction and feature selection. The study is structured as follows: The
problem definition – the methods used – the presentation of the results – the discussion and
conclusion.
