## About
This repository contains projects that illustrate my work and learning journey in machine learning. Each project is self-contained, with its own dataset (if available), code, and analysis. The projects demonstrate skills in:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and tuning
- Evaluation and metrics analysis
- Visualization
- Deployment (where applicable)

## Projects
Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
   A classic binary classification problem to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest are used to predict survival based on features such as age, gender, and class.

2. **House Price Prediction**  
   A regression model predicting house prices based on factors like square footage, location, and amenities. Utilizes algorithms like Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest.

3. **Customer Segmentation with K-Means**  
   Unsupervised clustering to identify different segments within a customer base based on purchasing behavior, which helps in personalized marketing.

4. **Image Classification with CNNs**  
   A Convolutional Neural Network model built to classify images, showing the power of deep learning in computer vision tasks. Transfer learning with pre-trained networks is also explored.

5. **Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data**  
   A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project to analyze sentiment in tweets. The project covers text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment prediction using models like Naive Bayes and LSTM.

More projects and detailed explanations are provided in each project’s folder.
