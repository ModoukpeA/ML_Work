# Summary

The project analyzes monthly community energy use data for the year 2010 in chicago to identify areas for improving
energy efficiency and develop models to predict energy usage accurately. The project uses data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building techniques such as label encoding, feature selection, and several machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting Machines, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN) with backpropagation.

The project evaluates the models' performance using Mean
Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. The results show that the
Gradient Boosting model performed the best for gas consumption, and the Artificial Neural
Network model had the lowest MSE for electricity consumption, while the GBM and Random
Forest models were the best for gas and electricity consumption, respectively, in terms of MAE. The project recommends using the GBM and ANN models for predicting energy consumption
with the lowest MSE and MAE values
