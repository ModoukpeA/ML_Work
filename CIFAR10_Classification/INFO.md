The goal of this basic project is to build an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This code uses TensorFlow and Keras to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images into ten categories (airplane, car, bird, etc.).

The model includes essential features like data augmentation and early stopping to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

### More information

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing
We load the CIFAR-10 dataset and normalize the pixel values by dividing by 255.0. This is to scale the data between 0 and 1 for better model performance.

#### Data Augmentation
To improve model generalization, we use ImageDataGenerator for basic augmentations like width/height shifting and horizontal flipping.

#### Model Definition
A simple CNN is built with 3 convolutional layers, each followed by ReLU activation and MaxPooling layers. This is followed by flattening and two fully connected layers. The final layer uses softmax for multi-class classification.

#### Model Compilation and Training
We compile the model with adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy as the loss function. Early stopping is implemented to avoid overfitting.

#### Evaluation and Visualization
After training, the model is evaluated on test data, and the accuracy is displayed. We plot training/validation accuracy and loss and show some sample predictions with true and predicted labels for quick visual verification.

## Data Augmentation Justification

Data augmentation is essential in training deep learning models, especially when the dataset is limited or prone to overfitting. It involves creating new training samples by applying transformations, such as flips, rotations, shifts, or brightness changes, to the existing images. This process effectively increases the dataset size without needing additional data, which is particularly valuable for training deep networks that benefit from more diverse examples.

By introducing variations, data augmentation helps the model learn features that better represent real-world scenarios, enhancing its performance on unseen data. It also reduces overfitting, as the model is exposed to slightly different versions of each image, preventing it from simply memorizing the training set. In our CIFAR-10 model, data augmentation strengthens the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to diverse angles, positions, and other variations that are common in real images, ultimately leading to improved accuracy and robustness.
